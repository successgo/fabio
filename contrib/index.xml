      <description>Your contribution is welcome! To make merging code as seamless as possible we ask for the following:
 For small changes and bug fixes go ahead, fork the project, make your changes and send a pull request. Check out the Development page for some useful tips. Larger changes should start with a proposal in an issue. This should ensure that the requested change is in line with the project and similar work is not already underway.</description>

      <description>For newcomers to Go, you can&amp;rsquo;t just git clone your forked repo and work from there, due to how Go&amp;rsquo;s GOPATH works. You can follow the steps below to get started:
 Fork this repository to your own account (named myfork below) Make sure you have Consul and Vault installed in your $PATH go get github.com/fabiolb/fabio, change to the directory where the code was cloned ($GOPATH/src/github.com/fabiolb/fabio) and add your fork as remote: git remote add myfork git@github.</description>
